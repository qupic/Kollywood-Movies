ACTION KING ARJUN SIR SUPER AND SK VERY GOOD MOVIE  IS AMAZING PLZ MUST WACH THIS FAMILY GOOD MESSAGE...😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Nice Film. The message is nice. Cinematography is fantastic and BGM is always Yuvan's fort. Kalyani has made her debut worth watching with a good performance. The comedy for siva is clicking after many movies.

this movie good inspiration for our youngsters and our children. so everyone must see this movie.. don't see like entertainment you guys get that content
such a good movie... every parents must watch... very strong content.. the way director carry this film was very cool... day by day Siva Anna acting was improved... action King was the real hero... the movie takes it's time to  introduce the hero it was acceptable... must watch film
SK'S biggest BLOCKBUSTER ever 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
nice movie bcoz of education system ma pathii sollu erukanga eppa erukara education system ah youngsters la athula eruntha veliya varanum nice concept
"A required message on eduction system, goes deep into our mind. Stage well set for mass hero , message oriented movie, good acting by all artists"
Sivakarthikeyan did what he said...Arjun sir's screen presence gave xtra support... Sivakarthikeyan's school look gave me a original skol boy feel.
"Director has well researched to make this a different movie compared to usual super hero movie. this superhero movie doesn't use lots of vfx, action sequences and science like Marvel cinematic universe but only relies on a well written screenplay. what amazed me is the way he elevated mass and sentimental scenes by not letting audience guess what gonna happen next. I happened to see some first time response of people coming out of theatre critisising screenplay and with disappointed face !! what do you expect a cliche superhero with lots of crappy vfx like krish3 or 2.0 that relies on technology rather than a solid script ??? there might be some sequences that questions logic but since I'm not so brilliant to critisise those i never minded those but was fully immersed into the beauty created by ps mithran. cinematography , bgm , action , direction was too good 💥🙏🏻  
Performance wise it's Action king Arjun who shined in mist if the parts. Siva had minimal role as a superhero and arjun's performance will make you understand why he is called action king !! it was a throwback to his old times where he was at his best. siva did what he was asked to do and lead heroine has nothing much to do. A must watch for all indian parents !! 
only negative was that you may find some cliche narration is some part as well in the script but considering it as a superhero movie that's negligible. yuvans bgm and George c willaims cinematography  elavated  every mass scenes to it best. some frames were jst lit 😍💯 concept is simple but screenplay and making made the difference. 
Rating : 8/10"
good...copy paste from all shankar movies.. ggood.. Good good...copy paste from all shankar movies.. ggood.. Good good...copy paste from all shankar movies.. ggood.. Good
Robo missing the second half  Good story best experience and and good news everything ok and love is not sutialble SK super act Arjun also fine
"Nice emotional movie for peoples who is having social responsibility and parents. Once again SK delivered inspirational movie like velaikaran. 
Initially it started with little note and songs made irritation to watch. But movie fine to good pace after it enters into main story"
"wonderful movie, taking us in an adventure of reality, definitely will help the parents to understand the irrelevance of marks of the students for a wonderful career. from the students point of view, will make the students to study practically. yuvan music is awesome, at some places we forget ourselves and go deep into the subject because of his music. Great Necessary Movie to watch."
nice attempt . slightly missing some blockbuster element . sk has choosen best subject but could've performed better .  body language must change depending upon the subject . overall a cool attempt
it's a paisa vasool movie and a family entertainer.  kudos to SK for accepting the script which provides more weightage to Arjun's character. technically very much in acceptable standards for the budget
"ஹீரோ மிகவும் அருமையான திரைப்படம்,
அனைவரும் பார்க்க வேண்டிய படம்.
ஆனால் ஒன்று நிஜத்தில் மக்கள் மாற மாட்டார்கள்.
திருந்த கூட முயற்சி செய்ய மாட்டார்கள்.
உண்மையை எடுத்து கூறினாள் முட்டாள் என்பார்கள்😢...
இந்த திரைப்பட குழுவிற்கு எனது சார்பாக வாழ்த்துக்கள்💐💐💐."
"Happy for the director and SK for doing this movie, as an actor he continue to choose script which influence the soceity positively. Watch the movie as a message, you'll easily surpass the flaws in it."

"such a good movie.good message film bgm is super.,👃🏿❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
worth watching Mithran Vera level thinking's innovative ideas ... Arjun sir always my fav gentlman sequel matri irku 😘😘😍😍 yuvan bgm 🥰🤔 villan last Vara sema mass
forgot about the slow screenplay and super hero parts. hero is worth watch for its message conveyed. hero film should be appreciated despite of all of its cons because of the message it delicers to the indian education system.
"everyone should watch.. there are many hero in our real life, so kindly give space to them. This movie showing how Indian are in our lifestyle.."
"Much needed movie, as most of them are victims of educational system. Suggest not to see blue sattai comments. He spoils all the good movies as he don’t know anything"
"Yuvan BGM vera level.. action king arjun,the true hero of the film.. SK 1st fighting scene marana mass.. Please do watch with ur family.. must watch muvi for all the parents and childrens.."
🎊🎊🎊then wonderfull movie 😍😍 sk anna is comeback must watchable movie 😘😘😘😎  sk anna acting an arjun sir acting also verithanam in movie🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Would have taken more interested one.story line was wonderful but director was convinced in between I guess. Siva gave much space to other actors which is good initiative.
first half was entertaining and grippy..  but second half was below average and not upto the hype created by first half.. one time watchable
"Every parents must encourage their child's positive note rather than comparing fellow one.
One of the best movie but climax was little bit clumsy but other than that best movie"
As usual 1st half good but after it's boring. Arjun acting is well. But don't expect for the movie my suggestion one time it will be go and watch it
worst movie! ukkara mudiyala baa😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦

"Good motivation for people with innovation!!! Arjun still a good action hero. Sivakarthikeyan looks so exhausted, and he is loosing his charm. The female actress also did her part well."
Premise was set from the very beginning scenes of the movie. There were some unwanted characters due to which there were some scenes which were dressed up
"Good movie. Worth watching it. Specially parents. Director,  SK and Arjun have done well. Though BGM is good,  music specialty songs could have been much better considering the stuff of Yuvan."
"Casting is awesome for this movie. SK Anna chance illa Vera level. Arjun sir character is really well maded.Kalyani character is not bad.
This movie talks about education system.
PS mithran sir conveys real messages to us.Please support new innovation."
in my small age my super hero is shakthimaan and power rangers. i never forgot that series till today but this movie has many good scenes inspired me and second half is mass and storyline is good
Content says it all. A must watch for the family audience. Especially parents. Should say the most successful superhero attempt in Kollywood.
The movie completely on the education system which is described in a proper manner and thus shows how to change that and introduce innovation in India.🤩🤩🤩
"overall a wonderful film... action king arjun mass, actually he is a hero in this film i felt ,SK supported him nicely... PS mithran given a good society msg"
😍😍Awesome movie must watch youngsters 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Unexpected story line🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Very nice script... Nice narrative.. Little more crispy in 2nd half... Overall good attempt and must watch ... SK nd Action king Combo works pakkaa...
very super Movie yethu solanum mo crta solirukanga very super dance sk acting vera level crt joys sk is film kids Rombavey pudikum but one Small mistake na very slow running but very very good IAM waiting Hero 2part waiting lovely action hero mv
Except climax sothappal first half was good... unrealistic climax... don’t how rocket was sent to earth orbit using helium balloon... serious comedy at some frame like this...
"new Batman is born,,,😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎"
Yuvan And P.S.Mithran give a perfect Entertainment and social msg for this society Action king Arjun done a great job And also Siva gives him beat BGM vera level...pakka mass movie
"Very good story, much needed one in the current situation of us surrounded by corporates... but the screen play makes everything dull, watchable with some yawning moments..."
"As a film, expect less... As a content tried like Gentleman 2. BGM, Arjun, Abhay deol terrific...must watch for BGM and dialogues...Dnt miss it..."
"Movie expressed my feeling, the person who feels about our education system really get goosebumps.. Good story..Every parent should watch the movie 💪💪"
"1st half only satisfied in this movie, worst making on 2nd half and everything not good and going to slow, avoid fight scene also not suitable for title"
"Director P.S.MITRAN had good experience in taking a social responsible subject like cybercrime,education system,etc.After the success of""IRUMBU THIRAI""which shows about corrupted cyber platform,he again back with""HERO"" which staring SIVAKARTHIKEYAN and ARJUN in lead role.In the movie he strongly opposes our spoon feeding ,corrupted education system and selfish attitude of parents.This movie delivers a very good message in proper form.It is not a superhero movie,morethan there are some elements.Strong Script and Good direction of this movie is to be appreciated.If you watch this movie with your parents,sometimes it maybe helpful to you in selecting your future.Here the INNOVATIVE Ideas Of BACKBENCHERS are praised.This movie is totally a STRONG STORM against  our CORRUPTED,UNLOGICAL,SPOON FEEDING EDUCATION SYSTEM.Here the director gives equal importance to each and every characters.Finally we can see that everyone in this movie was a HERO.The screen presence of ACTION KING is superb.Suitable BGM but other type of music like intro song etc didn't get up to the expectations.SK must be Proud to be in the part of this movie.One of the best of 2019."
this movie is a very good comeback for siva after a long period ...this deals with education where all should watch in theatres...it is similar to  gentleman with some heroic moments and concept Is good
Back to Black Buster🔥SK😍 Thalaivaa  waiting for HERO 2 hero 3😍🔥Padam Vera levela irku. SK 😍🔥Anna please select like this kind of script🙏🙏🙏
"Hero deals with our education system.We cant say it as a superhero film it remains as a good tamil movie👍👍👍positives of the film are writing,bgm,cinematography and arjun sir..Negative of the movie-I did not find anything...Parents go to this movie along with ur kids while returning ull know the mistakes done by you in giving education to your child🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥sk proves himself as a heroo❤❤❤❤in one word""HIT"""
This will be the last film I'm watching sivakarthikeyan's movie. seriously I don't watch sk movie anymore. worst climax... very very bad screenplay.. I expected lot from p.s. mithran... but he disappointed us.
Good message about change our educational system and how our corporate playing our life. Siva and Arjun acting very good. Block buster movie.
"Good movie, it can be watched with the family & kids. But little bit of exaggeration on the believability of several sequences is always questionable. Though the movie culminates on a rather rushed note, it is entertaining for most parts."
"its a modern day gentle man movie..must watch for parents
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👋👋👍👍👍👍👍☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺🙄🙄🙄☺🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄☺"
"Super movie a must watch movie for students , many scenes connect to real life of middle class students, a movie which ly questions please the education system but also gives a solution to it"
"Though the core story is worth the way they showed was not strong effective but OK to watch with entire family. 
songs were OK to watch. 
Some of the scenes were unnecessary or not build strong base. 
Arjuns strength not utilized completely but he is the pillar for the story"
I'm not a fan of SK but he tried something new which is very important in education system and that's y gave 100%. Plz try to do different roles like this rather than same old mokka comedy movies. Super movie but less than irumbuthirai. Director and Arjun was rocking
impractical at mkst of the times...though the issue is real one and impacting the society at large but without any practical solution  Seeing this using the one bought in birla planetarium...very nice👌🏻
Gentleman 2 Siva Karthikeyan version. Parents and Students Should watch. Overall A Nice family entertainer movie for this Christmas. SK vere level
"Story revolving around family sentiment with some twist. First half bit slow compared with second half. BGM is ok, One time watchable with family"
Vera level Movie Must watch in theatres don't see the stupid reviews Go and enjoy the movie Sivakarthikeyan's one of the best movie in his career don't miss it Arjun vera level 🔥🔥🔥
here few go to the to to the he got to go see go to go to the gym tonight to go see the see see jhhgx g hg be go for en route to the see the see see the he told to
"With the inventions being new, nothing new in the plot except few dialogues.. nothing is realistic. Looks like an extended version of gentleman. Songs were like disasters no song is even coming to my mind.. just the background score which elevated scenes.. Yuvan rocked in RR💓 SK 's ultimate Target is to set the young audience of 2030s, who are now in the primary school.. He succeeded because those kids were coming as groups and they are enjoying the film."
"Parents should watch this movie atleast once, and speak with you are children and make good choices for their children's life. So that everyone should watch this movie atleast once."
"good story concept,  much needed for today society.  hope this will create awareness to parents about their kids talent . but corrupted government and corporate will not allow us to think with the help of prostitute media"
"Arjun role is very nice. Sk acting super. bgm nice. Overall flim motivate all students, parents & teachers. waiting for hero part 2 flim. Must watch the movie with family."
"ஜெண்டில்மேன் படத்த இழுக்காம இருந்திருக்கலாம்!? இது சூப்பர் ஹீரோ படம் கிடையாது அதுக்கும் மேல, அர்ஜூன் கதாபாத்திரம் நல்லா இருந்துச்சு, அனைவரும் கணிக்கக்கூடிய கருத்தான எளிய படம், படக்குழுவுக்கு வாழ்த்துகள்"
Innovative ideas slightly workouts there is no combination between story and tilte of the movie.very expected movie but average output from sivakarthikeyan
Good Message and truly scientific. Director efforts seen on each shot. 1st half Screenplay was so good. 2nd half can be better. Siva gained more weight would advise him to reduce some weight. A Must Watch Movie
arjun tha ithula hero...pesama arjun padam full ah vanthrukalam...🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵🥵🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵🥵🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🔥🥵🔥🥵🔥🥵🔥🥵🔥🥵🔥
"Hero deserves the award for the content and way the screenplay doesn't make the film boring, moreover everyone has done their role perfectly"

Arjun performance is mindblowing ❤Support these kind of pure artand new kind of movie🙏🏻"
The inventions happening across India by the students without holding a qualification is shown remarkably . India is a country with youngest mind having lots of talents .

"decent movie.. don't go in with high expectations and you won't be disappointed. feels a bit draggy in the first half but the 2and half kinda makes up for it with action. Lesser songs in general, making it better there"
best screen play and good story then awesome act in action king lovely looking in heroine but very worsted in my money this movie poor movie not worked with sk in this only for homely taip of  movie hit all sk action movie floop so just stop action movie you can act good homley scripts
Arjun role is highlight in this movie. But some scenes looks over dramatic. I loved the scenes where they start collecting evidence. Yuvan Background is major highlight!😁
nice acting Arjun sir..good screen play and good music...but one time watchable movie...😎😎SK acting Vida Arjun sir acting Vera level...

After very long time we can take our kids and enjoy the movie...revolves around education and  how it has to be thought.. well directed super hero movie
It's a must watch for very parent who are enforcing their kids into something which they don't aspire for. And it talks about the current flaws in our education system and how it lobotomise a kids dream. And does state some of the true facts of how the corporate world suppresses cognitive thinking through education system and how it eradicates the disruptive innovative thinking..
this is not a commercial movie. the movie has a strong message to think about a kid's career. a nice watch movie with family. it will not disappoint. the songs are a bit boring though.
enjoyed the movie but screenplay can be better acting was good from sk the hero and Arjun was the hero of the movie for me loved his. heroine is cute has a great future overall it is watchable movie
"wonderful movie, name of title it shows movie real hero, every parents should watch movies, it's impact in my life and I check my daughter rough note, it's seems she like arts of drawing and now I encourage her to join in drawing arts Academy. thanks to PS Mithran"
"Parents should know their Kids Talents than Teachers.   Respect their Dreams, support them to shine. This movie showing business colleges attitude."
entertainment wise fine. But too much social message and issue and solution..oh my god.. I will run away.. Who is actually Hero. million dollar question to be asked.
"Very bored?concept is good,but screenplay is very bad.The only good is arjun acting.yuvan music is not up to the mark.Villan acting is awesome but all dummy piece in front of sivakarthikeyan."
education system should and must be changed.  nowadays education is the number one business industry. we ourselves responsibility for this situation. we have a solution for this.  ponpandimuthu tiktok
Good message & awareness for parents and people. Education system now collapsed. Must needed to corrupt it. Everyone should watch the super hero movie.
One of the best entertainment movie everyone should watch this movie with your family especially with your children's. Message conveyed by the director was extremely good.
"Good entertainment, can watch it once. Arjun role is very good, looks like gentleman part-2 but not upto a super hero subject, could have been more realistic."
Not bad at all. One time watchable.Siva need to act more in serious role.Something missed in this movie on his acting. He is not at all suitable in this role.
not bad. nice story..there is no acting. everything is went right😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
excellent movie..students and parents who were victims of this educational system and students pressurized by education and parents who spents lakhs on education will value this movie very much..this movie should go viral..but they purposely down this movie with negative reviews.. don't believe in them go for it..
This is very true movie and good driction we enjoyed the movie and SK Anna acting super and bgm is very lovely and enjoy the movie in all format I liked movie so much
Good  and nice social message movie.Good acting from Arjun sir and siva .Director mitran proved once again best young director in tamil.best of luck to whole team
"Small story, very good screenplay, in depth thinking of director about society, atlast a very good social message movie of the year... Inspirational"
Movie screenplay and research works are amazing. Many students can relate to their hidden talent which was lost in the course of time. Timely movie for parents forcing students in coaching centres
nice message has given very good movie  power  packed movie 😍😍☺️☺️😊😊😊☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤗☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️🤗☺️☺️🤗☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
Karthi and Sathyaraj does a cakewalk in their respective roles in this decent family thriller. Ample amount of twists and emotional connect gives a worthy watch.
siva karthikeyan another good movie after kaaki sattai. dialogue is very sharp. good villian. Arjun is youthful. story is right time delivery. overall nice film. some scenes are imaginary.
"sivakarthikeyan movie career intha movie Best movie, Arjun acting vera leavel, director p.s.mithram thank you sir intha mathri movie kuduthairku thank you sir"

The message in the movie is worth contemplating and acting on. But the superhero part made it unrealistic.. some of the songs and comedy sequence could have been removed..
screenplay is not good. SL acting s not good and he is delivering same performance. Arjuna sir is the real hero n he steal the show.  Director could have done this movie with Arjuna sir.
"good try to convey about innovation ideas of students, movie content is strong but somewhere the pitching is not up to the mark. arjun sir hold most of the scenes. P.S. Mithran sir inum konjam work out paniruntha, semmaya irunthurukum"
shd have given even more greater screenplay. and weightage to characters. more dialogues and second half draged. no core subject...that drives the film even faster..
bad way of carrying the concept. mithran failed to satisfy the expectations. throbbing points were overdoes. ending title card was best in the whole film
Movie looks like a Drama..speaking speaking...Nothing realistic and not even single clap in theater except for end card.  Something going wrong SK.Be careful!
"salute to d content!.. sk anna always rockss. 
u proved again anna jeichitom anna... wat a movie... eye opener for the students. every one must go and watch in theaters..."
the story plot was good but it didn't justify in its  screenplay. it was like Shankar's movie but it was not that effective. felt like it could have been better
"A one time watch movie.. with a over poured social messages,SK performance was gud,music was gud. Engaging first half,second half could been better"
"pretty good 1st half semma slow
2nd half bulky feeling ah irundhuchu
